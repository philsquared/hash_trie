A persistent hash array-mapped trie for C++

Please note that this repo is no longer maintained.

(slightly longer version: What is committed here is the state I got it to in order to support [my talk on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9dwdo700eQ). I had intended to round it out more fully, but before I really had a chance to do that I heard that Immer was gaining a phamt implementation, and I trusted that this would be a high quality implementation - so I never followed up).
